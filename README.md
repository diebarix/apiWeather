####icons animated
for icons animated i use [amcharts](http://https://www.amcharts.com/ "amcharts") that offert statistics and graphs, but too has some [free animated SVG weather icons](http://https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/ "free animated SVG weather icons"), with licenses  **Creative Commons**

####like i did
support me from a video tutorial and read documentation of the API, so only i was calling each data of the object wearing fetch, and i was showing it.
